Library of Python tools for use with Bluesky at the APS.

The `apstools` package provides supplemental support for data acquisition using
the `Bluesky framework <https://blueskyproject.io>`__ at the `Advanced Photon
Source <https://www.aps.anl.gov/>`__.  The support consists of a thin Python
interface to `EPICS <https://epics-controls.org/>`__ hardware, records,
databases, and other structures not already supported in `ophyd
<https://blueskyproject.io/ophyd>`__.
