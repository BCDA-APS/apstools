1.5.4
******

released 2021-11-25

NOTE: The ``apsbss`` component will be moved out of ``apstools`` into its
own package with the next release (1.6.0, ~Feb 2022) of ``apstools``.

Notice
-----------------

limitation to be relaxed, allowing any Python 3.7 and higher with the 1.6.0
release.

Fixes
---------------

* Added table of APS run cycle dates.  Use that if *aps-dm-api* not available.
* Restricted python version to 3.7 due to upstream *aps_dm_api* package.
* Rename name `uid` to `token` to avoid LGTM security false alert.

Deprecations
---------------

This support was marked as deprecated in release 1.5.4:

* ``apstools.devices.ApsCycleComputedRO``

1.5.3
******

released 2021-10-15

.. Format of the Change History changes with this release to make
   the layout become more relevant to the __reader__.  The
   `release notes <https://github.com/BCDA-APS/apstools/wiki/Release-Notes>`_
   on the wiki provide links to these specifics.

Notice
-----------------

The ``apstools.beamtime`` module and related content (includes ``apsbss``)
will be moved to a new repository for release 1.6.0. This will
remove the requirement that the APS data management tools (package *aps-dm*,
which only works on the APS computing network) be included.  With this
change, users will be able to ``conda install apstools -c aps-anl-tag`` on
computers outside of the APS computing network.

Breaking Changes
-----------------

* ``apstools.utils.listdevice`` has a new API (old version renamed to ``listdevice_1_5_2``)

New Features and/or Enhancements
---------------------------------------------

* Kohzu monochromator ``energy``, ``wavelength``, and ``theta`` each are now a ``PVPositioner`` (subclass).

* Linkam temperature controller T96
* Stanford Research Systems 570 current preamplifier
* Stanford Research Systems PTC10 temperature controller
* XIA PF4 filter now supports multiple PF4 units.
* Generalize that amplifiers will have a ``gain`` Component attribute.
* Generalize that temperature controllers will have a  ``temperature`` Component attribute that is a positioner (subclass of ``ophyd.PVPositioner``).
* Enhanced positioners for EPICS Devices:
  * ``apstools.devices.PVPositionerSoftDone``
  * ``apstools.devices.PVPositionerSoftDoneWithStop``

Fixes
---------------

* Fixed bug in ``devices.ApsCycleComputedRO`` and ``devices.ApsCycleDM`` involving ``datetime``.

Maintenance
---------------

* Moved all device support into individual modules under `apstools._devices` because `apstools.devices` module was getting too big.  Will refactor all with release 1.6.0.
* Add unit tests for ``devices.ApsCycle*`` Devices.
* Add EPICS IOCs (ADSimDetector and synApps xxx) to continuous integration for use in unit testing.
* Unit tests now use *pytest* package.
* Suppress certain warnings during unit testing.

Deprecations
---------------

This support will be removed in release 1.6.0:

* ``apstools.beamtime`` module and related content (includes ``apsbss``) will be moved to a new repository
* ``apstools.devices.ProcessController``
* ``apstools.utils.device_read2table``
